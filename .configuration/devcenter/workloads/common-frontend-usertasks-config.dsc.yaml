# Microsoft Dev Box Accelerator Frontend Development Configuration
# =============================================
#
# Purpose:
#   This DSC configuration creates a complete Azure Frontend development environment with:
#   - .NET development tools in both environments
#   - API testing tools (Postman)
#
# Requirements:
#   - Microsoft Dev Box Accelerator with Windows 11
#   - Administrator access for tool installation
#   - Internet connectivity for package downloads
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Uses Windows and WSL2 for a complete cross-platform experience
#   - Applies principle of least privilege where possible
#   - Maintains consistent environment between Windows and Linux
#   - Uses official Microsoft installation methods for all tools

    # Resource: Postman API Platform
    # Postman enables API testing and documentation, ensuring reliable integrations
    # between Frontend services and Azure APIs. This tool is essential for:
    # - Testing REST API endpoints from Azure services
    # - Creating and managing API collections for consistent testing
    # - Generating API documentation for team collaboration
    # - Setting up automated test suites for frontend-to-backend integration
    #
    # Using WinGet ensures we install the official, verified package.

    # Resource: .NET Workload Update
    # This resource ensures all installed .NET workloads are up to date, which is
    # important for maintaining compatibility with Azure services and security updates.
    # Following Microsoft's recommendation to regularly update workloads for optimal tooling.
    #
    # Frontend-specific .NET workloads include:
    # - Blazor for interactive web applications
    # - MAUI for cross-platform desktop/mobile applications
    # - ASP.NET Core for web APIs and server-rendered applications
    # - Azure Static Web Apps tools for serverless hosting
    # - JavaScript/.NET interoperability tools
