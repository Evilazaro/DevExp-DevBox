## Description

Contoso is a fictitious company utilizing Microsoft's DevBox to streamline the deployment of development environments. This repository offers a real-world simulation to demonstrate the capabilities of DevBox in a practical setting.

## Pre-Requisites

Before you delve into the project, ensure you have:

### 1. Environment
- The script should be executed on a Unix-like operating system with a Bash shell.
  
### 2. Required Software:
- **Azure CLI**: The script uses the Azure Command-Line Interface (`az`) for many of its operations. Ensure that you have the Azure CLI installed and updated to the latest version. You can check its installation with `az --version`.

### 3. Required Permissions:
- **Azure Subscription Access**: The user executing this script must have sufficient permissions on the target Azure subscription. This includes permissions for creating resource groups, deploying resources, and managing Azure AD identities.

### 4. Required Directory Structure:
The script assumes the existence of several other scripts in a specific directory structure. Ensure these scripts exist and are executable:
  
- `./identity/login.sh`
- `./identity/createIdentity.sh`
- `./identity/registerFeatures.sh`
- `./identity/createUserAssignedManagedIdentity.sh`
- `./network/deployVnet.sh`
- `./network/createNetWorkConnection.sh`
- `./devBox/computeGallery/deployComputeGallery.sh`
- `./devBox/devCenter/deployDevCenter.sh`
- `./devBox/devCenter/createDevCenterProject.sh`
- `./devBox/computeGallery/createVMImageTemplate.sh`
- `./devBox/devCenter/createDevBoxDefinition.sh`

### 5. Configuration:
- **Variables**: At the beginning of the script, several variables are defined (like `branch`, `location`, etc.). Review and adjust these values if necessary to match your Azure environment and naming conventions.
