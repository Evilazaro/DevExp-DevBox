## 📖 Overview

**Overview**

The Contoso DevExp Dev Box Accelerator is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
solution that automates the provisioning and configuration of Microsoft Dev Box
environments on Azure. It enables platform engineering teams to deploy fully
configured, developer-ready workstations with a single command, reducing
environment setup time from days to minutes.

This accelerator follows Azure Landing Zone principles to organize resources
into security, monitoring, and workload resource groups. It uses Azure Developer
CLI (`azd`) for orchestration, Bicep modules for infrastructure definitions, and
YAML-driven configuration for Dev Center settings — enabling repeatable,
auditable, and customizable deployments across development, staging, and UAT
environments.

> [!NOTE] This project uses the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) for provisioning.
> All infrastructure is defined as Bicep modules with YAML-based configuration,
> following the configuration-as-code approach.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Overview**

The accelerator deploys resources across three Azure resource groups following
Azure Landing Zone segregation principles. The orchestration layer (`azd`) runs
setup scripts that authenticate against Azure and the chosen source control
platform, then provisions all infrastructure through Bicep modules with
dependency ordering: monitoring first, then security, then workload resources.

The Bicep module hierarchy flows from a subscription-scoped entry point
(`main.bicep`) that creates resource groups and delegates to domain-specific
modules for Log Analytics, Key Vault, and Dev Center resources including
projects, pools, catalogs, and network connections.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Overview**

Get a Dev Box environment running in under 10 minutes. The accelerator supports
two deployment paths: automated via `azd up` (recommended), or manual setup
using the included scripts. The setup scripts handle tool validation,
authentication, and environment initialization — then `azd` provisions all Azure
infrastructure through Bicep.

> [!IMPORTANT] The setup scripts (`setUp.sh` / `setUp.ps1`) handle
> authentication and environment initialization only. They do **not** provision
> Azure resources. Use `azd up` or `azd provision` after running the scripts.

**Step 1 — Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evilazaro/DevExp-DevBox.git
cd DevExp-DevBox
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Cloning into 'DevExp-DevBox'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 350, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (350/350), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (350/350), 125.00 KiB | 1.25 MiB/s, done.
```

**Step 2 — Authenticate with Azure and source control:**

```bash
az login
azd auth login
gh auth login
```

> [!NOTE] `gh auth login` is required when using GitHub as the source control
> platform. For Azure DevOps Git, authenticate with `az devops login` instead.

**Expected output:**

```text
A web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/...
You have logged in. Now let us find all the subscriptions to which you have access...
✓ Logged in to github.com account
```

**Step 3 — Initialize and deploy (Linux / macOS):**

```bash
azd init -e "dev"
azd up
```

The `azd up` command triggers the `setUp.sh` preprovision hook defined in
`azure.yaml`. The hook validates prerequisites (`az`, `azd`, `jq`, `gh`),
verifies authentication, retrieves the source control token, and stores it in
the azd environment. After the hook completes, `azd` provisions all Azure
infrastructure through `infra/main.bicep`.

**Expected output:**

```text
Initializing a new environment (dev)...
SUCCESS: Environment initialized.

ℹ️ Starting Dev Box environment setup
ℹ️ Environment name: dev
ℹ️ Source control platform: github
ℹ️ Checking required tools...
✅ All required tools are available
✅ Using Azure subscription: Contoso-Dev (ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
✅ GitHub authentication verified successfully
✅ GitHub token retrieved and stored securely
✅ Azure Developer CLI environment 'dev' initialized successfully.
✅ Dev Box environment 'dev' setup successfully

Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-workload-dev-RG
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-security-dev-RG
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-monitoring-dev-RG
(✓) Done: Log Analytics Workspace
(✓) Done: Key Vault
(✓) Done: Dev Center

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure.
```

**Step 3 (alt) — Initialize and deploy (Windows):**

On Windows, if Bash is not available, rename `azure-pwh.yaml` to `azure.yaml` to
use the PowerShell-based preprovision hook, then run:

```powershell
azd init -e "dev"
azd up
```

Alternatively, run the setup and provisioning steps manually:

```powershell
.\setUp.ps1 -EnvName "dev" -SourceControl "github"
azd provision -e "dev"
```

> [!NOTE] The PowerShell setup script (`setUp.ps1`) requires `az`, `azd`, and
> `gh` (no `jq` dependency). Parameters use PowerShell naming: `-EnvName` and
> `-SourceControl` (accepts `github` or `adogit`).

## 📦 Deployment

**Overview**

The deployment process uses Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to provision all
infrastructure through Bicep. The setup scripts orchestrate authentication,
environment initialization, and the `azd provision` command. Two deployment
paths are available: a guided setup via scripts, or direct `azd` commands for
advanced users.

### Option A — Guided Deployment (Recommended)

**Step 1 — Authenticate and provision (Linux / macOS):**

```bash
./setUp.sh -e "dev" -s "github"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
✅ Prerequisites validated
✅ Azure authentication confirmed
✅ GitHub CLI authenticated
✅ Environment 'dev' initialized
✅ Provisioning complete
```

**Step 2 — Authenticate and provision (Windows):**

```powershell
.\setUp.ps1 -EnvName "dev" -SourceControl "github"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
✅ Prerequisites validated
✅ Azure authentication confirmed
✅ GitHub CLI authenticated
✅ Environment 'dev' initialized
✅ Provisioning complete
```

### Option B — Direct azd Deployment

**Step 1 — Initialize the environment:**

```bash
azd init -e "dev"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Initializing a new environment (dev)...
SUCCESS: Environment initialized.
```

**Step 2 — Provision resources:**

```bash
azd provision -e "dev"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-workload-dev-eastus-RG
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-security-dev-eastus-RG
(✓) Done: Resource group: devexp-monitoring-dev-eastus-RG
(✓) Done: Log Analytics Workspace
(✓) Done: Key Vault
(✓) Done: Dev Center

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure.
```

### Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources and clean up the environment:

```powershell
.\cleanSetUp.ps1 -EnvName "dev" -Location "eastus2"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Removing subscription deployments...
Deleting resource groups...
Cleaning up service principals...
✅ Cleanup complete
```

## 💻 Usage

**Overview**

After deployment, platform administrators manage Dev Box environments by editing
the YAML configuration files in `infra/settings/` and re-provisioning with
`azd provision`. Developers access their Dev Boxes through the
[Microsoft Dev Box portal](https://devbox.microsoft.com). All changes follow a
configuration-as-code workflow — edit YAML, commit, re-provision.

### Adding a New Project

Edit `infra/settings/workload/devcenter.yaml` to add a project under the
`projects` array. Each project requires network, identity, pool, environment
type, catalog, and tag configuration. Below is a complete project definition
based on the existing `eShop` project structure:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: 'myNewProject'
    description: 'New team project for backend services.'

    network:
      name: myNewProject
      create: true
      resourceGroupName: 'myNewProject-connectivity-RG'
      virtualNetworkType: Managed
      addressPrefixes:
        - 10.1.0.0/16
      subnets:
        - name: myNewProject-subnet
          properties:
            addressPrefix: 10.1.1.0/24
      tags:
        environment: dev
        division: Platforms
        team: DevExP
        project: DevExP-DevBox
        costCenter: IT
        owner: Contoso
        resources: Network

    identity:
      type: SystemAssigned
      roleAssignments:
        - azureADGroupId: '<azure-ad-group-id>'
          azureADGroupName: 'MyNewProject Developers'
          azureRBACRoles:
            - name: 'Contributor'
              id: 'b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c'
              scope: Project
            - name: 'Dev Box User'
              id: '45d50f46-0b78-4001-a660-4198cbe8cd05'
              scope: Project
            - name: 'Deployment Environment User'
              id: '18e40d4e-8d2e-438d-97e1-9528336e149c'
              scope: Project

    pools:
      - name: 'developer'
        imageDefinitionName: 'myNewProject-developer'
        vmSku: general_i_16c64gb256ssd_v2

    environmentTypes:
      - name: 'dev'
        deploymentTargetId: ''
      - name: 'staging'
        deploymentTargetId: ''

    catalogs:
      - name: 'environments'
        type: environmentDefinition
        sourceControl: gitHub
        visibility: private
        uri: 'https://github.com/org/myNewProject.git'
        branch: 'main'
        path: '/.devcenter/environments'

    tags:
      environment: dev
      division: Platforms
      team: DevExP
      project: DevExP-DevBox
      costCenter: IT
      owner: Contoso
      resources: Project
```

Then re-provision to deploy the new project:

```bash
azd provision -e "dev"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)
(✓) Done: Resource group: myNewProject-connectivity-RG
(✓) Done: Virtual Network: myNewProject
(✓) Done: Project: myNewProject
(✓) Done: Dev Box Pool: developer
(✓) Done: Environment Types: dev, staging

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure.
```

### Adding a Dev Box Pool to an Existing Project

Add a new pool entry under the target project's `pools` array in
`infra/settings/workload/devcenter.yaml`:

```yaml
pools:
  - name: 'backend-engineer'
    imageDefinitionName: 'eShop-backend-engineer'
    vmSku: general_i_32c128gb512ssd_v2
  - name: 'data-engineer' # New pool
    imageDefinitionName: 'eShop-data-engineer'
    vmSku: general_i_16c64gb256ssd_v2
```

Then re-provision:

```bash
azd provision -e "dev"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)
(✓) Done: Dev Box Pool: data-engineer

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure.
```

### Modifying Security Settings

Edit `infra/settings/security/security.yaml` to change Key Vault parameters. The
full configuration structure includes the top-level `create` flag and the nested
`keyVault` block with its tags:

```yaml
create: true
keyVault:
  name: contoso
  description: Development Environment Key Vault
  secretName: gha-token
  enablePurgeProtection: true
  enableSoftDelete: true
  softDeleteRetentionInDays: 90 # Changed from default 7
  enableRbacAuthorization: true
  tags:
    environment: dev
    division: Platforms
    team: DevExP
    project: Contoso-DevExp-DevBox
    costCenter: IT
    owner: Contoso
    landingZone: security
    resources: ResourceGroup
```

Then re-provision:

```bash
azd provision -e "dev"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)
(✓) Done: Key Vault: contoso

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned in Azure.
```

### Cleanup

Remove all deployed resources and clean up the environment using the cleanup
script. The script removes subscription deployments, users, role assignments,
service principals, GitHub secrets, and resource groups:

```powershell
.\cleanSetUp.ps1 -EnvName "dev" -Location "eastus2"
```

**Expected output:**

```text
DevExp-DevBox Full Cleanup
==========================

Retrieving subscription deployments...
Deleting users and assigned roles...
Deleting deployment credentials...
Deleting GitHub secret for Azure credentials...
Cleaning up resource groups...

All cleanup operations completed successfully.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Overview**

All deployment parameters are driven by three YAML configuration files in
`infra/settings/`, plus a Bicep parameters file for environment-specific values.
Each YAML file has a corresponding JSON Schema for validation. The YAML-driven
approach allows teams to customize environments without modifying any Bicep
module code, and schemas provide IDE autocomplete and validation support.

> [!TIP] All YAML configuration files include JSON Schema references (via
> `yaml-language-server: $schema=...`) for editor validation and autocomplete
> support in VS Code with the YAML extension.
