## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview of the Business layer architecture
for executive stakeholders.

The Business layer architecture defines the fundamental business capabilities,
processes, and organizational structures that support the **ContosoDevExp
Microsoft Dev Box Accelerator** project's strategic objectives. This project
establishes a centralized developer workstation platform with role-specific
configurations and appropriate access controls, enabling organizations to
provision and manage secure, consistent developer environments at scale.

**Source:**
[devcenter.yaml](../../../infra/settings/workload/devcenter.yaml):L1-L14

This architecture follows TOGAF 10 Business Architecture principles and aligns
with Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Landing Zones. The solution
bridges the gap between business strategy and technical implementation by
providing:

- **Centralized Developer Platform Management** - A single control plane for
  managing developer workstations across the enterprise
- **Role-Based Environment Provisioning** - Tailored developer environments for
  backend and frontend engineers
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment** - CI/CD workflows for consistent
  infrastructure provisioning
- **Security-First Design** - Azure Key Vault integration for secrets management
  with RBAC controls

[azureResources.yaml](../../../infra/settings/resourceOrganization/azureResources.yaml):L1-L14

### Key Highlights

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Capabilities | 5 capabilities identified (Platform, Security, Monitoring, Workload, Connectivity) |
| Core Processes        | 5 processes documented (CI, CD, Release, Setup, Cleanup)                           |
| Organizational Units  | 2 units mapped (Platform Engineering Team, eShop Developers)                       |
| Strategic Alignment   | Azure Cloud Adoption Framework, Developer Experience                               |
| Transformation Impact | Enterprise-wide developer standardization                                          |

### Strategic Drivers

**Source:**
[devcenter.yaml](../../../infra/settings/workload/devcenter.yaml):L1-L14

1. **Developer Productivity** - Reduce environment setup time and provide
   consistent, optimized developer workstations
2. **Security & Governance** - Implement RBAC with principle of least privilege
   and centralized secrets management
3. **Cost Optimization** - Right-sized VM SKUs for different role types and
   centralized resource management
